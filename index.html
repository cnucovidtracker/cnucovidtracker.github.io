  <h5 class="card-header">Why?</h5>

    <p>
      I'm a CNU <a href="https://adamfendley.com/">alum</a> who is disappointed in CNU's lack of transparency and handling of COVID-19 cases.
      I am worried for current Captains who reside on campus this year, and I believe that CNU's mishandling of this data puts them in more danger due to lack of proper information.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this, <a href="https://cnu.edu/relaunch/">CNU's official COVID Dashboard</a> offers only a <strong>bar</strong> graph showing the current number of reported "active" cases, broken down by student and employee cases.
      Historical data and trends are not available. In addition, CNU's bar graph has a minimum graph height of a seemingly completely arbitrary 50 cases, making the real reported number look small in comparison.
      Even with this lacking representation, it appears that the numbers displayed on this dashboard have <a href="https://twitter.com/MommaBear867/status/1299708072663887877">not always been accurate</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem as though whoever maintains this dashboard could do with re-taking some of <a href="https://cnu.edu/academics/liberallearning/corecurriculum/">CNU's own liberal learning requirements</a> on mathematical literacy, which I am confident had a lesson on proper data representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, despite ever-changing case numbers, CNU's <a href="https://twitter.com/CNUcaptains/status/1298612120595181570">tone-deaf</a> social media presence continues to portray the campus as <a href="https://twitter.com/CNUcaptains/status/1299003573452386304">safe</a> and allows community members to feel as though this is a <a href="https://twitter.com/CNUcaptains/status/1300426383139778562">regular semester with only minor inconveniences</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data would be much better served directly from CNU, rather than a hastily-created and unofficial website without insight into key data and case details.
      In order to become more transparent, CNU must do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Transition the official COVID-19 dashboard to a line graph or similar representation including historical numbers</li>
      <li>Publish currently active case numbers exactly once daily at a preset time</li>
      <li>Note clearly any errors or updates to the reported number of cases</li>
      <li>Indicate the date when any new positive COVID-19 case is reported to the university</li>
      <li>Disclose the total cumulative number of unique positive cases which have been reported</li>
      <li>Disclose the total number of students instructed to quarantine due to a positive reported case</li>
    </ol>
